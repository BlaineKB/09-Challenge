# 09-Challenge-Professional-README-Generator

## Description
A professional README generator that produces a completed README file after all inquirer prompts have been answered. This was constructed using Node.js, Inquirer, and JavaScript.

## Usage
A user starts the generator by navigating to the root directory and typing "node index.js" in the terminal. Then the user is met with a series of prompts that produce the content of the README once they have been completed. A professional README file is then generated upon completion.
